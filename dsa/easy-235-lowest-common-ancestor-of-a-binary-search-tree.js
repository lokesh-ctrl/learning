// https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/

// Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @return {TreeNode}

      root = root.left;
    } else if (p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) {
